# Phase 4.3: WhatsApp-Only Documentation Sweep (Condensed)

## Summary

Planned a complete documentation sweep to eliminate all ~414 SMS/MMS references across ~20 files. The code was already WhatsApp-only, but docs still contained SMS-era terminology, constraints (160-char segments, 1MB MMS ceiling, A2P 10DLC), and architectural decisions that no longer applied. This was scoped as a full phase rather than a drive-by fix because many references affected acceptance criteria, graduation gates, and Phase 5's entire scope.

## Key Decisions

- **WhatsApp only, not "messaging-native"**: All references use "WhatsApp" specifically; no dual-channel or generalized terminology
- **Update everything including historical phases**: Phases 1-3 updated to reflect current WhatsApp reality rather than preserving SMS as historical record
- **Remove SMS-specific concepts entirely**: A2P 10DLC, toll-free verification, carrier testing, 160-char segments, 1MB MMS ceiling, out-of-order delivery — all removed
- **Phase 5 restructured**: Diffs render as monospace code blocks in WhatsApp (not PNG images for SMS); PNG rendering deferred to Phase 16 for large diffs only
- **Phase 11 graduation criteria updated**: WhatsApp-only (delivery reliability, 24-hour session window, Business API setup); no carrier testing or A2P compliance
- **WhatsApp constraints documented**: 4096-char limit, 16MB media, 1 media per message, 24-hour session window, monospace code blocks, in-order delivery, read receipts

## Outcomes

- Source code, skills, PRD, README, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, CLAUDE.md, and Phase 4 already clean before this phase
- Remaining work: ~45 refs in historical phase plans, ~219 refs in completed plan files, ~20 refs in future phase plans, ~97 refs in brainstorms, ~10 refs in config/other
- Product name "textslash" retained (already messaging-agnostic); long-form name "WhatsApp Agentic Development Cockpit"

## Status

Completed — Implemented in Phase 4.3
